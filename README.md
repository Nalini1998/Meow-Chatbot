# Meow Chatbot

I used Html code for basic tags like we create a heading and paragraph for user instructions. And create an input field using Html. And in CSS code, I completely styled the main page of the chatbot. Styling input field where the user types a question and gets an answer. And in my final Javascript code, I created a function for question and answer. So if users type a specific word they get a specific answer that I wrote in javascript code. So this way we create our chatbot using Html, Css, and JavaScript.
